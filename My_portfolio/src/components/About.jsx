          I’m at the beginning of my software development journey, after graduating from CodeSpace  
         I have been working on various projects and growing my skills with self-guided learning. 
         From building simple web applications to experimenting with DevOps concepts, 
         I’m constantly seeking new challenges that push me to think critically and improve my craft.
         When I am not coding, you can find me on a golf course at the 🏌🏾‍♂️, in a  pool 🏊🏾‍♂️ or gym 🏋🏾‍♂️.
